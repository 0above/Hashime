# Hashime - A Go Library for Hash Detection

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/:badgeContent?style=social)

## Overview

Hashime is a Go library designed for efficient hash detection and verification. It helps identify and verify different hash types, making it useful for building hash crackers, hashing your own code, and other hash-related tasks.

**Note: Hashime is currently in an early development stage (undersaturation). The library is not yet feature-complete, and changes are expected.**

## Features

- **Support for Multiple Hash Algorithms**: SHA-256, MD5, SHA-1, and more.
- **Efficient Hash Detection**: Designed for performance and ease of use.

## Installation

To install Hashime, use `go get`:

```sh
go get github.com/0above/Hashime
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use Hashime for detecting hash types:

### Basic Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/0above/Hashime"
)

func main() {
    data := []byte("example data")

    detector := hashime.New()

    sha256Hash := detector.CalculateSHA256(data)
    fmt.Printf("SHA-256: %x\n", sha256Hash)

    md5Hash := detector.CalculateMD5(data)
    fmt.Printf("MD5: %x\n", md5Hash)
}
```
