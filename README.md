## ðŸŽ¯ What is Hashime?

Hashime is a lightweight Go library designed to help you detect and identify different types of cryptographic hashes. From MD5 to SHA-512, weâ€™ve got you covered.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Hereâ€™s how to get started with Hashime.

### Installation

Getting Hashime up and running is a breeze. Simply add it to your project with:

```bash
go get github.com/0above/Hashime/hashime
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use Hashime for detecting hash types:

### Basic Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/0above/Hashime/hashime"
)

func main() {
    hash := "5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592" // Example MD5 hash

    // Detect the hash type
    hashType := hashime.DetectHashType(hash)

    // Convert the detected hash type to string and print it
    fmt.Printf("Detected Hash Type: %s\n", hashime.HashTypeToString(hashType))
}
```

### Terminal Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/0above/Hashime/hashime"
)

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) < 2 {
        fmt.Println("Please provide a hash value.")
        return
    }

    hash := os.Args[1]

    // Detect the hash type
    hashType := hashime.DetectHashType(hash)

    // Convert the detected hash type to string and print it
    fmt.Printf("Detected Hash Type: %s\n", hashime.HashTypeToString(hashType))
}
```

Run it from your terminal:

```sh
go run main.go 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
```
